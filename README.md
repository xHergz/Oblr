# Oblr
Oblr is a web application that can be used to keep track of obligations. The main goal of Oblr is to give the user a clean, simple interface to organize things that need to get done. It will aim to be a cross platform solution that can be used to quickly identify what the user needs to get done on the fly, while still offering some basic customization for more in depth analysis. Obligations fall into 3 categories: Tasks, Events, and Duties.

## Tasks
Tasks are things that need to be completed once by a specific date.

## Events
Events are things that will occur at/during a specific time.

## Duties
Duties are things that need to be completed on a repeated schedule.
